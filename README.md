# rock_paper_scissors
Building a rock paper scissors game, as part of the Odin Project

The game will be for five rounds

I first want to test if the user entered a valid answer choice, case insensitive, then move onto the rest of the game from there.

What I would like to achieve is:
    display both the players and the computers answer
    display the score
    display who won the game and if it was a tie
